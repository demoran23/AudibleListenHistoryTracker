A chrome extension to keep track of your listen history on Audible.

Audible only tracks a couple of months worth of listen history.  
This extension will extend that time frame to indefinitely, but it can only work
with the data it has.

It will occasionally poll Audible's [listen history page](https://www.audible.com/account/listen-history) 
to update its list.
